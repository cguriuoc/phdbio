# Generative AI for Medical Imaging

This repository contains code and experiments related to my PhD research on the application of Generative AI to medical imaging. The primary focus is on using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), CycleGANs, and future explorations into Diffusion Models for various tasks related to medical image analysis.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate generative models that can:

*   Enhance medical images
*   Synthesize medical images from different modalities
*   Generate realistic synthetic data for training other machine learning models
*   Aid in medical diagnosis and research

## Current Focus

Currently, the repository contains implementations and experiments with:

*   **GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks):** Basic GAN architecture for generating kidney histopathology images.
*   **CycleGANs:** Implementation of CycleGANs for image-to-image translation, with a specific focus on unpaired kidney histopathology image datasets.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the KMC Kidney Histopathology Dataset, available on Kaggle:

*   **Source:** [KMC Kidney Histopathology Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sachidwivedi1234/kmc-kidney-histopathology-dataset-1)
*   **Description:** This dataset contains kidney histopathology images from the Kidney Medical Center (KMC). It is used to train and evaluate the GAN and CycleGAN models.
